Program Description: A graphing program written in Python 3 to receive values from Serial through Python for graphing and recording to later read. A data logging tool basically, useful to test and otherwise monitor sensors and particular values sent through from the Arduino microcontroller. Uses the serialpy library to easily grab sent values through serial. It currently can only read and write to .txt files. The specific formatting will be found in an example text file in this repository named "Test_data_large".
